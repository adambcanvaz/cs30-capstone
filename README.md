# Good Burger, Phenomenal Burger.

A time-management simulation game developed in JavaScript using the p5.js library. The player manages a burger restaurant over the course of 7 days, unlocking new ingredients, managing difficult customers and their riddle orders, and balancing finances to progress.

## Controls
* **Mouse:** Interact with the UI, buy ingredients, and navigate menus.
* **Spacebar:** Switch between the **Restaurant** and **Kitchen** scenes.
                If in kitchen, pressing space will also serve the customer.
* **'Z' Key:** Undo the last ingredient added to the burger.
* **'C' Key:** Clear the entire burger.

## Game Features
* **7-Day Progression:** The game gets harder each day with new customers, increasingly difficult riddles and higher rent costs.
* **Economy:** Players must manage Cash (for ingredients) and XP (for winning the level/day).
* **Shop:** Ingredients and upgrades unlock as the player progresses.
* **Save/Load System:** The game automatically saves progress using the browser's Local Storage.
* **Shift System:** An in-game day typically runs from 8AM to 6PM, equivalent to 3 real minutes.
* **Customer Patience:** Customers will leave if they wait too long or if the order is wrong.

## Technical Details
* **Language:** 100% Javascript.
* **Library:** p5.js.
